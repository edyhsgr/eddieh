      <br>
3.5 lb wheat liquid malt extract<br>
3.5 lb pale liquid malt extract<br>
1lb Vienna malt, cracked<br>
1lb white wheat malt, cracked<br>
1 medium watermelon<br>
1oz Fuggles hops<br>
1oz Tettnanger hops<br>
1packet dry wheat beer yeast (safbrew WB-06)<br>
3/4cup corn sugar<br>
<br>
Steep the Vienna and wheat malts in 0.75gal of 175degree water for 15min.<br>
Strain and sparge with hot water to 1.25gal. Turn on range and heat to 150degrees.<br>
Add the extracts and bring to boil.<br>
Add fuggles when the boil is rolling, and continue on high for 45 minutes. Stir frequently.<br>
Cut up watermelon and puree in a blender. Strain juice through strainer into wort.<br>
Add Tettnanger hops and continue boiling the wort for 15 minutes. Stir frequently.<br>
Put 1 gallon cold water into fermenter.<br>
Ladle wort slowly through strainer into fermenter.<br>
Add cold tap water to ~5gal mark.<br>
Take original gravity reading.<br>
At 70-80 degrees, aerate with a large spoon, add yeast, and seal.<br>
When yeast activity slows, move to a secondary fermenter (glass carboy) for 5-7 days.<br>
Bottle with corn sugar and leave in closet for two weeks.<br>
<br>
Starting SG: 1.060 (Day 0)<br>
2o fermentation started (Day 7)<br>
Bottled (Day 13) SG: 1.012<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 32: Cracked open the first bottle. 
Good carbonation and had an unfiltered, golden appearance. 
It was a little hoppy with a faint watermelon undertone. There was an odd aftertaste at first, 
but it seemed to mellow out throughout the drink. May just need time.

1.9gallon Santabot Stout replica, only good. <br>
      <br>
2lb Liquid light extract<br>
.25lb American chocolate malt<br>
.25lb British roasted barley<br>
2oz chocolate syrup<br>
1Tbsp Fuggles hop pellets (5% alpha acid) <br>
1/2 packet dry American Ale yeast <br>
      <br>
Steep the chocolate malt and roasted barley in 175 degree water for 15
minutes<br>
Strain and sparge with 170degree hot water to 1.5gallon. <br>
Add extract and chocolate syrup and bring to a boil. <br>
Add 1/2Tbsp hops when boil is rolling, and continue on medium for 45
minutes. Stir frequently. <br>
Add 1/2Tbsp hops and boil for 15 more minutes. Stir frequently. <br>
Turn off heat, let sit for 15minutes in cold bath. <br>
Pour into fermenter and add cold water to 1.9 gallons.<br>
Aerate with ladle and pitch yeast.<br>
Leave in fermenter for 6-10 days. <br>
Bottle in two, one-gallon jugs with a sieve and funnel and some sugar
for carbonation, cap, and let it sit in the closet for a week. <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 0: Went almost perfectly.
Had a little (big) spill when transferring to the fermenter (due to the
Santabot 1!), but overall felt really good about the process-- very
smooth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day 40+: Was a failure--
virtually equivalent to the first Santabot Stout, which is a good
thing, since now I'm pretty sure that first failure wasn't due to poor
mashing skills. Pretty sure the big problem is in the bottling-- a
screw top just doesn't do the job of a crown cap, and no carbonation=no
crispness. Should be an easy fix.<br>

4.5lb 2row malt <br>
.25lb honey malt<br>
.25lb American chocolate malt<br>

2oz chocolate syrup<br>
1Tbsp Fuggles hop pellets (5% alpha acid) <br>

      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 0: The mash (in my
2gallon pot) again had oatmeal consistency-- went
well. Didn't take an original gravity reading-- broke my hydrometer a
couple beers back, and didn't feel the need to borrow one on this one.
The funnel trick for cooling that I made up (I have another plan for
next time if still no wort chiller) didn't work to cool the wort and
pitch the yeast fast, so I just let it sit
overnight-- this is a Big no-no, but I've had to do it before, and I
know others who have done it, and doesn't seem too ruinous (by my
standards) when dealing with such a dark ale-- I'd like to make a small

gallon jugs to bottle in. Overall: Should be a good Christmas drink.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day 30: FAILURE! Flat, weak
flavor...well, it'll get you drunk, I can tell you, so there's that

      <font face="HELVETICA"><font face="HELVETICA"><font size="3"><font
 size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal is a small
(1.8gallon), basic, all grain beer. <br>
      <br>
4lb 2row malt <br>
1lb biscuit malt <br>
1Tbsp Tettnanger hop pellets (3.8% alpha acid) <br>
1/2 packet dry American Ale yeast <br>
      <br>
Mash the malt in 1gallon of 150-155degree water for 60min. Stir
frequently. <br>
Strain and sparge with 170degree hot water to 1.5gallon. <br>
Bring to a boil. <br>

Add 1/2Tbsp hops and boil for 15 more minutes. Stir frequently. <br>
Turn off heat, let sit for 15minutes. <br>
Pour into fermenter and add cold tap to 1.8gallon <br>
Bathe the fermenter in ice water until it's 70-80degrees. <br>
Take original gravity reading. <br>
Aerate with a large spoon, add yeast, and seal. <br>
Leave in primary fermenter for 6 days. <br>
Bottle in three growlers with a sieve and funnel and some sugar for
carbonation, cap, and let it sit in the closet for a week. <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 0: Ferrantellis came over
for support. The Tenenbaums were present as well. The mash (in my
2gallon pot) was like oatmeal-- went well except made a mistake and put
the pot on a hot burner for a few minutes after mashing and before
sparging-- hopefully don't get a bad tanin flavor. Doesn't seem too
bitter for wort. I'm concerned too much biscuit. Had a 1.048 initial
gravity. Should
find a better chilling technique-- I waste a lot of water in the bathe.
Overall: looking good. All-grain baby! This is a milestone.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Day 7: Fermentation had more bubbles than
I've seen before, probably because of that sticky biscuit malt, but
bubbles is good. Had a 1.012 final gravity, just as
Rob predicted-- that is
great-- I think that means that my mash worked, and I have alcohol in
there and I have Beer! Bottling was easy as pie.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day 21: I opened one of the three
growlers (the half-filled one) for drinking, and am very disappointed--
tastes like apple juice-- similar to how the first beer we made tasted
after 6 months-- not bad, but not beer. Maybe something was wrong with
my mash temperature. Also, no carbonation-- maybe because it's only
half-full, maybe because I opened it to smell about a week after
bottled. It did make a big "pfff!" sound when I opened it today, but
that pfff is in the bottle, and aint in the beer. Brewing is like
golf-- ups and downs.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day 26: Just opened the second
growler (a full one), and it is Outstanding. Great flavor, color,
clarity, and carbonation. I'm really happy with it. A great basic beer.
I will have to figure out why the variation happened-- good beer
brewing is all about repeatability.<br>

      <font face="HELVETICA"><font face="HELVETICA"><font size="3"><font
 size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small (1gallon),
very strong beer, with my first partial mash. <br>
      <br>
3/5lb 2row malt <br>
1/10lb honey malt <br>
2lb liquid amber extract <br>
4oz honey <br>
1tsp Fuggles hop pellets (5% alpha acid) <br>
1/2 packet dry yeast <br>
      <br>
Mash the malt in a grain bag in 1/2gallon of 150-155degree water for
60min. Stir frequently. <br>
Strain and sparge with 170degree hot water to 1gallon, then throw out
the spent grain. <br>
Stir in the extract and bring to a boil. <br>
Add 1/2tsp hops when boil is rolling, and continue on medium for 45
minutes. Stir frequently. <br>
Add 1/2tsp hops and boil for 15 more minutes. Stir frequently. <br>
Turn off heat, let sit for 15minutes. <br>
Pour into fermenter and add cold tap to 1gallon <br>
Bathe the fermenter in ice water until it's 70-80degrees. <br>
Take original gravity reading. <br>
Aerate with a large spoon, add yeast, and seal. <br>
Leave in primary fermenter for 6 days. <br>
Bottle in two growlers with a sieve and funnel, cap, and let it sit in
the closet for a week. <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 3: My first mashing
experience, and it went really well. Had a 1.100 og reading(!). I also
took specific gravity on just the mashed grain wort (took a little out
before I added the extract and honey) and had 1.018. I used .7lb of
grain-- .6 of tworow and .1 of honeymalt. According to the guy at the
supply shop, honeymalt is a specialty and should only use a little--
the "honey" refers to a flavor that it gives, he said-- I thought it
was the color. It was bubbling real well the morning after, and I was
hoping to get the gravity down-- and hoping maybe that honey would dry
it out some. Keeping the mash temperature went really well, but it was
tricky since we have an electric coil burner-- I kept a cup of water
nearby to cool in case, and only needed to use it once (near the
beginning)-- didn't get out of range, so that was good. Can't wait to
mash some more grain-- do a full mash next time. 1-2 gallons is a
perfect size brew for me-- a lot easier and more enjoyable in small
quarters. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 7: Went ahead and bottled
it today (Halloween)-- it's been dead for a few days now. Bottling was
very easy-- 20minutes-- great. The beer is questionable-- not sure what
I've got-- it is very strong (couldn't take a reading because my
hyrdrometer fell and broke the other day), but the flavor is not good
at all-- I think the yeast might have been overwhelmed, and couldn't
finish the job. Hopefully it will improve, but I'm not too concerned
either way-- 'Relax, have a homebrew.' I should make a label for this
one-- a Bill the Butcher label-- <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.demog.berkeley.edu_-257Eeddieh_images_TheTabletopMassacre.jpg&amp;d=DwMGAg&amp;c=9g4MJkl2VjLjS6R4ei18BA&amp;r=it44mhcjSS383q3IN64SPDSO2j8HvIGHzOTjLsTmEzI&amp;m=llywuCALUoVvh_7k5loJ2SBc1RhB81twL69b1Te8-EI&amp;s=fuccHm5ryYwPnKgN3-W4iOaLkYVsfdP6yNTSGMivsEw&amp;e=" target="_blank">Here</a> is the prototype. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 21orso: Was pretty bummed
about it for awhile. It did not go well. Just too much sugar (and hence
alcohol) for the yeast that I used-- it couldn't transform it all, and
I ended up with a very worty concoction at about 8%abv. Had to toss 1/3
of it that I experimented with. Now that I'm pretty sure of what
happened, I'm feeling better about it. I should try it again and use a
champagne yeast, or similar robust. I'm drinking it out of a wine glass
and still enjoying it. Not sharing it with anyone. <br>

solid, nutritious beer that a guy can have bacon and eggs with. <br>

7.5lb liquid light malt extract <br>
1.5lb Belgian Munich malt <br>

      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 0: Ivonne was studying
when I was inspired, so I flew solo on this one. I did the sanitizing a
little bit different this time: usually I over-do it, and I think I get
a slight off-taste for it, so this time
I did things a little lighter (and less wasteful), with a very light
water-bleach solution and a kitchen towel, and all a few hours before,
so it could air out and
the bleach would all clear without a ton of rinsing. I read an article
recently that said people should actually let the city water they brew
with sit for a few hours so that the chlorine additives will evaporate
from it, but I didn't go that far-- maybe next time.
Had a strong 1.062 gravity reading. Had to wait a few hours to pitch
the yeast (~74degrees). It's chugging.
It looked good and I think it will taste good.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 8: I just transferred to
a carboy that fellow brewers the Ferrantelli's lent me: I used an
'auto-siphon' that Eric recommended, and it worked <i>great</i>-- no
more battles and cursing. The auto-siphon may push me to always use a
carboy-- there's just no reason to use a bucket over a carboy if I've
got an auto-siphon, and scratches in buckets (which I have in my two
buckets ever since I got them in the mail, even though one is a free
replacement that I got after I complained about the scratches in the
first one-- it's madness-- 'MonsterBrew' sucks) can create problems. I
used StarSan for sanitizing, which I used when I started brewing, and
is a good product (I wanted to get something called 'one-step'
(cleaner/sanitizer) but they don't carry it at the local brew store). I
had a 1.020 gravity reading at this stage. The brew looks and tastes
crazy-- like an opaque lambic mixture with some orange juice and
fiberone-- I like it, but don't know if I should, haha. Since it may
still be in a green stage, there is just no telling what I've got on my
hands-- it could go any way. It didn't have any strangeness at the top,
so I'm thinking it's not infected...also, I don't really believe in
beer infections anymore-- if medieval English people could make
drinkable beer, then I'll be darned if I don't...that said, this may be
a brew that only its maker will love. A couple comments about the
ingredients (don't know why I didn't really make any before): I went
with the Saaz hops because they are mild, and I wanted a lot of mild,
which I felt/feel would go toward 'heavy'. I am not sure of the exact
effect of the 'Belgian' yeast-- that may well be what's driving the
current (and future) madness, even though, at least before, I didn't
think that a dry yeast packet could do such crazy stuff...maybe I
should get more info about yeast(!). The intention of the flaked barley
is to give weight (I want this beer to fill my stomach like a
sandwich), and it has been confirmed by Rob that the barley should not
ferment (would need a mash to do that), so it will just give weight and
head and perhaps some interesting flavors. Eric concurs that the flaked
barley should be good for weight and feel. From research online: 1/2lb
should be just about right to not go overboard with barley. I will be a
little surprised if I find people desiring bacon and eggs with this
brew, but I will also be surprised if I don't really enjoy it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 30+: Bottled these at
least a couple weeks back, and the couple I tasted after just a week in
the bottle had a strong sour flavor, like a lambic, but with age they
are changing, and I think getting better and better-- losing the
sourness, becoming more refreshing. The Ferrantelli's commented that
they reminded them of the New Belgium 'Abbey', so that was a nice
compliment. [they also thought of 'Fat Tire', which we all think isn't
so good, haha, but a homebrew Fat Tire is always good] All in all, I'm
proud of the product, and am really enjoying it while it lasts. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 0 (Dec 6): We had no more
than a half-moon last night, and partial cloud cover, so decided that
conditions were satisfactory for brewing this beer with cover from
any other bard-survivalist spirits. The Ferrantellis came over on very
short notice to offer outstanding support, labor and beer. The
Kreigers, as always, offered a compass to initiate our heading. Had an
original gravity reading of 1.06. Had to leave overnight to cool before
pitching the yeast. Day 1: Pitched the yeast at around noon (~74
degrees). Day 2: Lots of activity. Our new bucket is opaque, so can't
see sediment, but there should be a lot to deal with. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three weeks later (Dec 26):
The Higgins Unleashed did very well. Bottled earlier than normal, even
for us, so that we could bring it to New Mexico for Christmas, but it
was through fermenting. The final was down to 1.018 from 1.060, both at
74degrees, so with bottle aging it should be ~6% abv, which is
suitable. The early bottling added some oomph to the carbonation--
which is outstanding-- Higgins should Cannon out of those bottles. The
cherry comes through well and a little sour-- a little of a lambic
taste-- Unleashed-- a unique and good tasting beer overall. We're
pleased. The look and color is great-- unabashedly unfiltered, which is
reminiscent of some of Higgins' poetry-- some of Higgins' work in haiku
could certainly be considered unfiltered. <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.demog.berkeley.edu_-257Eeddieh_images_HigginsUnleashed.jpg&amp;d=DwMGAg&amp;c=9g4MJkl2VjLjS6R4ei18BA&amp;r=it44mhcjSS383q3IN64SPDSO2j8HvIGHzOTjLsTmEzI&amp;m=llywuCALUoVvh_7k5loJ2SBc1RhB81twL69b1Te8-EI&amp;s=PTurW0QUUihFyh79Hs27X6T1zQFZ5QzzroCRR9WWCjY&amp;e=" target="_blank">Here</a> is a prototype of the Higgins Unleashed

      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 0: Had a good original
gravity reading of 1.052. Used Rob Kreiger's primary fermenter. Rob put
together the recipe, less the selected madness-- adjustments were made
based on convenience: '<i>Relax</i>, have a homebrew.'
Day 5: Slow start, then went nuts for a brief (1.25 day) period, and
now back to slow. It's nuts. Good smells. Day 8: Transferred to the
secondary fermenter. Had 1.021 gravity reading. Looks and behaves just
like the Pumpkin Brewster at this point-- needs lots of settling.
Tastes great though, so don't care that it's not beautiful.
Day 15: Bottled it: tastes great, looks great. All of the sediment
stayed at the bottom of the carboy, and we now have our cleanest brew
yet (except maybe the kit one). Put an actual maraschino cherry in
eight of the bottle. Will send two bottles (without the actual
cherries) to next weekend's <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__seakfair.org_beerfestival.htm&amp;d=DwMGAg&amp;c=9g4MJkl2VjLjS6R4ei18BA&amp;r=it44mhcjSS383q3IN64SPDSO2j8HvIGHzOTjLsTmEzI&amp;m=llywuCALUoVvh_7k5loJ2SBc1RhB81twL69b1Te8-EI&amp;s=zKfl20B41oVpWhccQkWsk4rm0WwYN1mNWKhQ7UP-nLA&amp;e=" target="_blank">Haines

place at the Haines Brew Festival (what do they know?), but got some
pretty good comments. All of the beer was really good. Our only
'problem' was that, for the ones without the maraschinos (the ones with
the maraschinos all turned out perfect), the cherry flavor wasn't very
noticeable...and that they all got drunk (drunk? drank? dranken?...). <br>

      <br>
3lb Brewers Gold dry malt extract <br>
3lb extra light dry malt extract <br>
1/2lb chocolate malt, cracked <br>
1/2lb caramel 10, cracked <br>
29oz canned pumpkin <br>
1tsp "pumpkin pie" spice <br>
1oz Centennial hops <br>
1packet dry brewers yeast <br>
3/4cup corn sugar <br>
      <br>
Steep the chocolate and caramel malts in 0.75gal of 175degree water for
20min. <br>
Strain and sparge with hot water to 1.25gal. Turn on range and heat to
150degrees. <br>
Stir in the extracts, spice and canned pumpkin and bring to boil. <br>
Add hops when the boil is rolling, and continue on high for 45 minutes.
Stir frequently. <br>
Ladle wort slowly through strainer into fermenter. <br>
Add cold tap water to 4.91782gal mark. <br>
Take original gravity reading. <br>
At 70-80 degrees, aerate with a large spoon, add yeast, and seal. <br>
When yeast activity slows, move to a secondary fermenter (glass carboy)
for 5-7 days. <br>
Bottle with corn sugar and leave in closet for two weeks. <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 0: Had a good original
gravity reading of 1.054. Had a taste of the wort before pitching the
yeast-- I think it's gonna be good. Making a lot of noise in the
fermenter!
Day 7: Transferred to the secondary fermenter.
Day 12: Strange activity (more lively than expected) and smells,
Transferred back primary (now tertiary) fermenter. Bottled between the
15th and 20th day (I lost track). Final gravity: 1.018 or lower. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple weeks later, after
strange smells and concerns that something had gone terribly wrong,
lot's of sediment and siphening issues, getting hosed down with it, and
heated arguments about what to do with it, the Pumpkin Brewster lives.
At one point we had a green-apple smell coming off of it in the primary
fermenter, which made us concerned, but I've thought about each step,
and I'm sure it was properly sanitized. When dealing with
non-traditional brews (like one with a can of pumpkin dropped in it), I
think we'll never know what smells and looks "right" during
fermentation. I'm no expert, but I don't think anyone else could know
either, that's one thing that makes it interesting. Rob Kreiger, the
DOLPM expert, provided moral support throughout, and tested it out for
us, giving it the thumbs up for drinkability. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not a great beer, and it
certainly has some distinctly amateur elements (lots of crazy sediment
(your very own sandcastle with every bottle) and a little bit of an
iodine taste (may go away a little with aging)), but it's definitely
drinkable, and it's got enough alcohol, so it's good enough for me. We
can't taste much or any pumpkin in it, but pumpkin's not a really
strong taste. When I drank the first couple I said it was similar to
the DOLPM Blackheart, but then last night I had my last Blackheart--
it's on a completely different level than anything else we've done--
the Blackheart is gold. The Pumpkin Brewster's not bad though-- it'll
give you a nice buzz and help you sleep better. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May, 2008: Had a couple of
these this month, and they have gotten much better with age. Tastes
much better than I remembered. Careful pouring gives a dark, but clean,
reddish beer. <br>

a taste of the wort before pitching the yeast, and it has a definite
bite at this point...Month later: it was in the primary for 7 days and
the secondary for 7+. It's a good beer, but a little bit of wortiness I
think-- am hoping that age will fix this. Looks great and the bubbles
are perfect. Can definitely taste some spruce. October: better and
better. <br>

3lb extra light dry malt extract <br>
1lb Vienna malt, cracked <br>
1lb wheat malt, cracked <br>
1 medium watermelon <br>
1oz Fuggles hops <br>
1oz Tettnanger hops <br>
1packet dry brewers yeast <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had an original gravity
reading of 1.046, and "final" gravity of 1.021 (but I think the <i>final</i>
final gravity was somewhat lower). Have had a few bottles, and we like
it a lot, but there's something a little weird about it that we can't
pin down-- sometimes we love it, and sometimes, not so much. Has good
body, a little bite from the alcohol and hops, and sweetness from the
watermelon. Color and opacity is characteristic for an unfiltered
wheat, with the addition of some pink. Carbonation is perfect...(month
later)...Have had several more bottles, and we love it-- it's nectar. <br>

      <font size="3"><strong>January 2007: DOLPM Blackheart
Stout</strong></font></h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the less than unique
wheat kit, and the well intentioned but less-than-carefully managed
Christmas Bomb, we decided to get a little more serious and do
something nice. Luckily, a small group of large minds known only as the
DOLPM decided to unite in support of this next brew. We hope that it
can be used by the DOLPM to battle the Juneau wind, rain and snow. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our initial plan was to do a
stout with molasses, but in honor of Valentine's Day, Ivonne and I
decided that some chocolate would be great, hence the DOLPM Blackheart
Stout is fittingly a chocolate stout. There are other Blackheart
Stouts, but this is the DOLPM Blackheart Stout. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the expertise
of the DOLPM, we built the beer with help from the <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__hbd.org_recipator_&amp;d=DwMGAg&amp;c=9g4MJkl2VjLjS6R4ei18BA&amp;r=it44mhcjSS383q3IN64SPDSO2j8HvIGHzOTjLsTmEzI&amp;m=llywuCALUoVvh_7k5loJ2SBc1RhB81twL69b1Te8-EI&amp;s=sRfr9pzZ3s_MtfsDSEndKIPbzGtQetgYGcskFX-Z6lk&amp;e=" target="_blank">Beer Recipator Spreadsheet</a>, which is an
outstanding resource. <br>
      <br>
1can light liquid malt extract <br>
3lb light dry malt extract <br>
4/3lb American chocolate malt, cracked (350L) <br>
2/3lb Roasted barley, cracked (300L) <br>
8oz chocolate syrup <br>
1oz Fuggles hops <br>
1oz Kent Goldings hops <br>
1packet dry brewers yeast <br>
3/4cup corn sugar <br>
      <br>
Steep the chocolate malt and the roasted barley in 1.5gal of 175degree
water for 15min. <br>
Strain and sparge with hot water to 3gal. Turn on range and heat to
150degrees. <br>
Add the extracts and the chocolate syrup. Add fuggles when the boil is
rolling, and continue on high for 45 minutes. Stir frequently. <br>
Add Kent Goldings hops and continue boiling the wort for 15 minutes.
Stir frequently. <br>
Put 1 gallon cold water into fermenter. <br>
Ladle wort slowly through strainer into fermenter. <br>
Add cold tap water to ~5gal mark. <br>
Take original gravity reading. <br>
At 70-80 degrees, aerate with a large spoon, add yeast, and seal. <br>
When yeast activity slows, move to a secondary fermenter (glass carboy)
for 5-7 days. <br>
Bottle with corn sugar and leave in closet for two weeks. <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had an original gravity
reading of 1.058-- very happy about this. Left it in the primary
fermenter for eight days, and have a gravity reading of 1.026, yielding
~4.1% alcohol. Left it in the secondary fermenter for five days before
bottling, to clear out some of the sediment. The gravity reading at
bottling was an unchanged 1.026. We weren't sure if the yeast would be
able to eat the chocolate syrup (I now think the syrup just settled to
the bottom, uneaten, but would matter very little either way). After a
taste out of the primary, I was sure it was good-- oishii desu. It
reminded me of a cream stout. I then had a taste out of the secondary
fermenter, and found that it gained a smoky flavor. Finally, after
bottling and carbonation (outstanding head-- tall and frothy), we're
left with a great stout. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to this beer's
success was certainly the expertise of DOLPM Associate Rob Kreiger--
the best home brewer I know-- he trained with a fabled master in the
far-reaches of SW AK, and he brews with great precision and intensity. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;November, 2007: Just had one
last bottle, and nothing else we've done comes close to this. <br>

online <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__hbd.org_recipator_&amp;d=DwMGAg&amp;c=9g4MJkl2VjLjS6R4ei18BA&amp;r=it44mhcjSS383q3IN64SPDSO2j8HvIGHzOTjLsTmEzI&amp;m=llywuCALUoVvh_7k5loJ2SBc1RhB81twL69b1Te8-EI&amp;s=sRfr9pzZ3s_MtfsDSEndKIPbzGtQetgYGcskFX-Z6lk&amp;e=" target="_blank">beer recipe database</a>,
and using ideas from recipes in the "Special" recipe section, we put
together a recipe-- unfortunately we didn't use the <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__hbd.org_cgi-2Dbin_recipator_recipator&amp;d=DwMGAg&amp;c=9g4MJkl2VjLjS6R4ei18BA&amp;r=it44mhcjSS383q3IN64SPDSO2j8HvIGHzOTjLsTmEzI&amp;m=llywuCALUoVvh_7k5loJ2SBc1RhB81twL69b1Te8-EI&amp;s=o63rz8cvzvCMU__pnDEB6kHs8-V6udqvBIUD-EsWFQ8&amp;e=" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>
program, as that would have given us much better proportions. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we had in our kitchen
cabinets had a large impact on our recipe decision making: <br>
      <br>
1can Thomas Coopers Amber Malt Extract <br>
1lb honey malt (color 2.5L) <br>
1lb Vienna malt (color 3.5L) <br>
3/4lb Bavarian Weizen malt (color 8L) <br>
2oz Tettnanger hops <br>
12oz honey <br>
4- 6" cinnamon sticks <br>
1oz grated ginger <br>
1oz grated orange peel <br>
10 all spice balls <br>
1tsp ground nutmeg <br>
1tbsp cardamon <br>
1 packet dry brewers yeast <br>
3/4 cup corn sugar <br>
      <br>
Boil 2gal water with the honey malt, Bavarian and Vienna malts for 15
minutes. <br>
Add Cinnamon, ginger, orange peel, all spice, nutmeg, cardamon, and 1oz
hops. Continue to boil for 30 minutes. <br>
Add honey and boil for 10 minutes. <br>
Add remaining hops and can of Amber malt extract and boil for 2
minutes. <br>
Strain out the large sediment. <br>
Pour into fermenter and cool with 5 (should instead try 4-4.5 first)
gallons of water to 70-80 degrees. <br>
Take gravity reading, add yeast, seal fermenter, and place in the 70
degree closet. <br>
Take periodic gravity readings after 5 days until the values flatten
out. <br>
Bottle with corn sugar and leave in closet for two weeks. <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had a disappointingly low
1.022 original gravity reading, which after seven days has lowered to
1.011 for just 2.1% alcohol...so lame...this means many trips to the
lavatory. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bottled it on the eighth day,
had a lot of trouble getting siphens. Had a taste: awful-- like a
bottle of perfume, but who knows what will happen?. We'll soon see if
it was worth all of the labor, I have doubts. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked at the bottles on the
eleventh day: at first I thought they had a good darkness, then I
turned a bottle over and there were so many floaties! It looked like
twigs and dirt in there! Reminded me of an Indonesian home remedy
called arat, which has old (decades old) sticks and bugs and
what-have-yous in it. I like some sediment, but this is sort of
ridiculous. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had a few glasses between the
second and third weeks, and am more and more pleased-- I'm enjoying it
even more than the Hef we did. The spice taste is relatively strong,
but that's what we wanted. It's great for Christmas. Good head, though
we have to be careful to not pour the bottom sediment into the glass.
I'd like 4-5% alcohol next time. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May, 2008: Had the last
bottle today-- a big 22oz-- it was beautiful in the glasses, like a
dark champagne-- head stayed while I drank the first one and second
(wanted to pour them at once to keep the sediment down). Tasted great--
kind of like a cider. Fairly low alcohol, but the two gave me a little
buzz. A big, gray something-or-other came out when I was cleaning the
bottle. <br>

      <font size="3"><strong>October 2006: Thomas Coopers
(Australian) Wheat Beer Kit</strong></font></h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is our first brew. I got
brewing supplies as a belated birthday gift from Ivonne. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything came from "<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.gourmetalaska.com_&amp;d=DwMGAg&amp;c=9g4MJkl2VjLjS6R4ei18BA&amp;r=it44mhcjSS383q3IN64SPDSO2j8HvIGHzOTjLsTmEzI&amp;m=llywuCALUoVvh_7k5loJ2SBc1RhB81twL69b1Te8-EI&amp;s=Mz_8HmFP52sacLcQ7hbjLQRLzGm8CChqoJrVFpOFfbk&amp;e=" target="_blank">Gourmet Alaska</a>", a kitchen supply store in
Juneau's "<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__nuggetmalljuneau.com_&amp;d=DwMGAg&amp;c=9g4MJkl2VjLjS6R4ei18BA&amp;r=it44mhcjSS383q3IN64SPDSO2j8HvIGHzOTjLsTmEzI&amp;m=llywuCALUoVvh_7k5loJ2SBc1RhB81twL69b1Te8-EI&amp;s=NHQKwjNz_bd5WInALGOxXHr9HJvwHHrKmx35FVmANNE&amp;e=" target="_blank">Nugget Mall</a>". <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We both love wheat beer, as
it has two of our favorite qualities: sediment and smoothness (our
other favorite quality is coffee/chocolate flavor-- I love stouts and
porters on nitrogen tap). <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we had no brewing
experience, we followed the Coopers kit's instructions to the letter,
with Ivonne as the director and me as the labor. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coopers is a popular brand
for home brewing, and I've been told that this is the result of
relatively high taxes on beer sales in Australia, and a resultant high
demand for home brewing products, which Coopers took advantage of. <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a very simple heating of
the grain/hop extract to a boil, then immediate cooling in the five
gallon fermenter. <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used tap water from our
bathtub for enough space and quick cooling. We cooled it very
efficiently with our Juneau tap in fact, and added ~.1 more gallons of
water to get it back up to ~65 degrees (this was unecessary, and just
watered down the beer a little). <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original specific gravity was
1.026-- low, but not very low for a wheat beer. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the fermenter do it's
work in the privacy of our closet, after seven days the specific
gravity got down to 1.013, for an alcohol content of just 2.3%. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__hbd.org_ensmingr_&amp;d=DwMGAg&amp;c=9g4MJkl2VjLjS6R4ei18BA&amp;r=it44mhcjSS383q3IN64SPDSO2j8HvIGHzOTjLsTmEzI&amp;m=llywuCALUoVvh_7k5loJ2SBc1RhB81twL69b1Te8-EI&amp;s=huCOUTS_DdfSFdWtqzZBF_iiQ9jXvyfsHjY5orBntbE&amp;e=" target="_blank">Here</a> is a great website that explains the alcohol
content that is yielded by given conditions. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bottled it on the seventh
day, which is always my favorite part of brewery tours, so was fun to
do-- 50 bottles of beer in our closet. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had a taste of it before
bottling and any carbonation, and was a little disappointed with the
flavor, but hoped for improvement in the bottle. After a week in the
bottle it was much better, if only for the bubbles. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the weeks went on it
improved more and more. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rob, a friend and amazing
brewer (best home-brewer I know) from work had a taste of it after a
month and a half, and generously commented that he enjoyed it, and that
it had all the elements of a good wheat beer, but that there should be
great improvement with the addition of wheat flakes and/or other
specialty grains. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall we're pleased, will
save two bottles to taste again in a year. <br>
